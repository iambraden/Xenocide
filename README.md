Game Title:

Xenocide

Core Concept
Briefly describe the game:

Our game is inspired by Galaga, but we will be implementing roguelike elements such as randomized enemies, enemy placements, and powerups the player can choose. Defeat means starting over with a fresh set of challenges.

Core Gameplay
Game Loop
Describe the basic actions the player takes and how they interact with the game:

The player moves a spaceship left and right to avoid danger and shoot enemies. Destroying enemies grants experience points. Given enough points a player will level up, the user can choose between random power ups, making the ship stronger.

Player Controls
List the controls clearly and simply:

A & D (Moving left and right)

Space bar (Shoot)

Shift (dash (once unlocked))

Escape (pause (make sure you’re not in fullscreen mode))



Level & Progression

Game Structure:
Hand crafted enemy types, with random procedural generated spawns.
Players can collect power ups to get stronger.
Repeating loop that increases difficulty as time goes on.

Progression System:
As the player progresses they will encounter more numbers of enemies and more difficult enemies.
More difficult enemy types may have: faster movement, faster attacks.
Players will continuously unlock power ups to make their ship stronger as the game goes on.
This may be represented as increasing the players stats: Health, Movement Speed, Attack Speed, bullet speed.
Or this may be represented by gaining new abilities such as: Damage shields, different types of attack, new movement options.


Scoring & Win/Loss Conditions
Winning:
Players get as far as they can. “Winning” can be as simple as beating the first boss or getting far enough that the player is satisfied.
Losing:
Player loses if their ship health drops to zero.
Score System:
Player earns points for killing enemies.
